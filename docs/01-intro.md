# Introduction

I assume you have written _some_ CSS, so let's quickly go through some basics:

## Prerequisites

- Install the [axe extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/) to test your a11y.

Note: your page has to be served (as opposed to be loaded from the filesystem) for the axe extension to work, e.g. through `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

## Quick refresh

- [Selectors](02-selectors.md)
- [Units](03-units.md)
- [Layout](04-layout.md)

## Focus of the workshop

- Semantic HTML
- [Flexbox](10-flexbox.md)
- [Animations](11-animations.md)
- [Transitions]()
- [CSS custom properties]()
- [Accessibility (a11y)]()

# Cheat sheet / tips
