## Opinionated advice ðŸ¤“

- Use `rem` for everything! You can tweak this unit with the document's font size.
- But use `px` for "hairline" styling, like borders.
- Be aware that relative unites might cause "rounding errors". This can become apparent in animations, precise alignment or specific shapes.
